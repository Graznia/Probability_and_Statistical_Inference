# LOGICAL ARGUEMENTS

# Often we want to start with a vector of 0's and then modify the entries in later code. R makes this easy with the replicate function rep()

# rep(0, 10) makes a vector of of 10 zeros.
x = rep(0,10)

# rep() will replicate almost anything
x = rep(2,6)

x = rep('abc',5)

x = rep(1:4,5)


for (j in 1:5)
{
  print(j^2)
}
